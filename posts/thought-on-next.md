After using Next.js for a month, I can say that the experience is really positive and I am really fall in love with this framework. Now, having only play with Static Generation, next I will try learning and using Server Side Rendering feature and also possibly the hybrid of the two worlds. I am also planning to participate in the Hashnode + Vercel hackathon so this is the opportunity to apply this new knowledge by building an app.
